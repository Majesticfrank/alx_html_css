                UNTOLD STORY BEHIND NIGERIAN POLITICS
            </h1>
            <h2>The Rough Edges of Tribalism</h2>
            <P>The Nigerian problem currently is its structure — the concentration of exclusive powers in the centre,
                in an unrefined ethnic-religious-conscious state.
                I stand with whosoever says that the Nigerian problem did not begin with the amalgamation of the south and north
                of the country
                by the British colonial authorities, because the country was governed, I dare say, successfully, by the
                different Governors-General that represented the British Crown.
                Our problems partly began when religious and ethnic sentiments, schemed in Ibadan, were used in an attempt to
                achieve a coalition. This was in January 1950,
                during what is known today as the Constitutional Review Conference, which brought for the first time (Jose, 32)
                the leaders of the amalgamated northern and southern regions,
                split at the time of the conference into three — east, west, and north — by the very constitution being
                reviewed. After rejecting the ministerial system of government proposed at the conference,
                the northern leaders, invited by the Yoruba leaders staying in what was called Catering Rest House,
                Ibadan, sat in a meeting.</P>

            <h3>There was Greed or Ignorance</h3>
            <p>he problems that destabilised Nigeria were not at all created during and after the Nigerian Civil War. It partly
                began with the excesses of the Action Group.
                It is the abolition of the true federation, practised in the country, by Major General Aguiyi Ironsi, that dealt
                the greatest blow to everything about Nigeria.
                It is this unfortunate move by Ironsi that brought the “ethnically negative” minds out to raised the alarm that
                the Igbo were on the verge of dominating other groups in the country.
                This explanation was reasonable to the untutored minds who were fully aware that it was the bloody coup
                championed by some Igbo soldiers that brought Aguiyi Ironsi, an Igbo, to power, and with this power,
                Ironsi took away the powers vested on the regions of the country, and arrogated them to himself. The fear roused
                by this deed raised the same cries heard in the backward societies watching dragons of darkness from the moon
                swifting to boot off the sun,
                the light, the sustainer of life, to cause perpetual darkness enjoyed by the moon. It first claimed Ironsi’s own
                life before it went down swiftly and claimed the lives of innocent citizens of the eastern origin,
                especially the Igbo, who could hardly say what Ironsi did or what it meant. But ironically, the exclusive powers
                which Ironsi greedily or ignorantly instituted are still there, threatening the existence of the country.
                If Ironsi was killed for arrogating exclusive powers to himself, and those who killed him are today using those
                powers to ride the country to the directions of their choice, opposing directly and indirectly the call to
                restructure the country, isn’t it absurd?</p>

            <h2>Extremism — The Deadly Edge</h2>
            <p>
                It is the excesses emanating from the use of exclusive powers to direct the affairs of the country that made a
                good number call for the devolution of political powers to the regions of the country.
                Those opposing this campaign are not ignorant of the fact that restoring the powers of the regions will not only
                send all the battling groups in Abuja back to their regions,
                but will bring back the competition that had uplifted the country. The Muslim north, the only region opposing
                this campaign, is not ignorant of the good things this restructuring will cause.
                It believes that with its ‘huge’ population, in this democratic era, it has conquered the Christian south, since
                no one from the south will ever win any presidential election in the country without depending on the ‘huge’
                population of the north.

            <h2> Examplars</h2>
            <p> There are great names that have not been honoured, or honoured enough.
                A bitter culture among Nigerians is the tendency to remember and reward goodness when those who exhibited it are
                no more.
                Remove this custom, the likes of Olusegun Obasanjo will be heroes. The reason is simply because Olusegun
                Obasanjo never
                in his service years to Nigeria made himself a tribal hero.
                He may have victimised many of those who opposed his attempt to retain power in 2007, and may have been charged
                with corruption,
                but these, as disturbing as they are, are never a grave threat to the unity of Nigeria as tribalism and, the
                worst,
                religious extremism storming now from the north. And the wars and conflicts he ended and prevented on our
                continent speak for him. He is, at the moment,
                the best leader that Nigeria has had. He is followed by the late Umaro Musa Yar’Adua, whose brief stay in power
                saw the welfare of the country uplifted.
                Yar’Adua was a fine Muslim, educated, detribalised, upright, and transparent. By diplomatically defeating the
                Niger Delta militants with his amnesty programme,
                he demonstrated how discerning he was in a difficult country like ours. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is the next
                admired leader Nigeria has had. If he had restructured the country,
                and amended the 1999 Constitution,
                as suggested by the National Conference he convoked in 2014, he would have had a broader place in history.</p>
